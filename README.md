# Discord Rich Presence

## About

Risk of Rain 2 does not currently expose game information to Discord, and so this mod was created in order to integrate Risk of Rain 2 with Discord's rich presence system. Relies on BepInEx and R2API.
Available from [Thunderstore.io](https://thunderstore.io/package/WhelanB/DiscordRichPresence/)
## Current Features

Currently, rich presence is only provided for Classic Runs. The current stage count and stage name are exposed to Discord Rich Presence. Icons give an at-a-glance view of the current stage, and hovering over the icon reveals the stage subtitle.

Character information, current run time and more are planned in future updates

## Installation

Requires R2API. Extract contents of zip to Risk of Rain 2/Bepinex/Plugins/

## Build Steps

Made using [DiscordRPC](https://github.com/Lachee/discord-rpc-csharp/). See barebones build steps for Unity3D at base of [readme](https://github.com/Lachee/discord-rpc-csharp/blob/master/README.md) to build the required libs (included).
